    Data_Practices:
        Introduction to Pandas:
            - Powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
            - Designed for working with relational or labeled data.

        Data Structures:
            - Primary structures: Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D).
            - Series represents a column or row, while DataFrame is tabular.

        Data Handling:
            - Pandas handles various data types: numeric, categorical, etc.
            - Data manipulation mainly done with DataFrames and Series.

        Working with Data:
            - Apply operations to DataFrames or Series with Pandas' methods.

        Reading and Writing Data:
            - Use `.read_csv()` and `.to_excel()` for reading/writing tabular data.
            - E.g., `.to_excel()` converts DataFrame to Excel sheet.
