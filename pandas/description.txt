    - Pandas is a powerful library in Python for data manipulation and analysis
    - expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data 
    -  pandas is built on top of NumPy 
    - The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional)

    tutorial: 
    what kind of data pandas handle?
    Import the package, aka import pandas as pd
    A table of data is stored as a pandas DataFrame
    Each column in a DataFrame is a Series
    You can do things by applying a method to a DataFrame or Series

    How do I read and write tabular data?
    - To convert csv to excel sheet use .to_excel()

3_apr:
    - Made a .py file from .ipynb file
    - Setup the pre-commit
    - setup the .ipynb_checkpoints for jupyter notebook

4_apr:
    - select a subset of a DataFrame
    - create plots in pandas
    - create new columns derived from existing columns

5_apr:
    - calculate summary statistics
        - Aggregation statistics can be calculated on entire columns or rows.
        - groupby provides the power of the split-apply-combine pattern.
        - value_counts is a convenient shortcut to count the number of entries in each category of a variable.
    - reshape the layout of tables
        - Sorting by one or more columns is supported by sort_values.
        - The pivot function is purely restructuring of the data, pivot_table supports aggregations.
        - The reverse of pivot (long to wide format) is melt (wide to long format).
    - combine data from multiple tables
        - Multiple tables can be concatenated both column-wise and row-wise using the concat function.
        - For database-like merging/joining of tables, use the merge function.
8_apr:
    - Handle time series data
        - Valid date strings can be converted to datetime objects using to_datetime function or as part of read functions.
        - Datetime objects in pandas support calculations, logical operations and convenient date-related properties using the dt accessor.
        - A DatetimeIndex contains these date-related properties and supports convenient slicing.
        - Resample is a powerful method to change the frequency of a time series.
    - Manipulate textual data
        - String methods are available using the str accessor.
        - String methods work element-wise and can be used for conditional indexing.
        - The replace method is a convenient method to convert values according to a given dictionary.
